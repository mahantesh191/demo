Based on the provided sample configuration schema and the user query, here's the generated configuration file for the L3 VPN with the specified parameters. 

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the generated configuration:
1. **VRF Definition:**
   - The `vrf definition` for `Client_A` specifies the route distinguisher (RD) based on the loopback address of the CE router (`10.0.4.1`) and a placeholder AS number (`65001`).

2. **Route Target:**
   - The `route-target` for import and export is set to `65001:100`, which can be adjusted based on actual design requirements.

3. **Interface Configuration:**
   - The interface `GigabitEthernet0/1`, which connects `CE-A1` to `PE-1`, is specified to use the VRF `Client_A`.

4. **BGP Configuration:**
   - The BGP configuration under AS `65001` includes the IPv4 address family for the defined VRF and establishes a neighbor relationship with `10.0.4.2` which is the IP address of the CE router, along with its AS number `65002`.

This configuration file can be used to push into NSO for setting up the L3 VPN for the client specified in the query. Adjust the AS numbers and route targets as necessary for your specific networking setup.
