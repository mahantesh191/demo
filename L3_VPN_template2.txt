Based on the provided user query, variable values, and the sample configuration schema, here is the generated configuration file for setting up an L3 VPN with the VRF name 'Client_A' on the PE router 'PE-1':

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.4:100
    route-target export 100:1
    route-target import 100:1
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 100
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 200
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Configuration Breakdown:
1. **VRF Definition**: 
   - VRF Name: `Client_A`
   - Route Distinguisher (RD): `10.0.4.4:100` (using `ConnectedRouter's IP: AS number`)
   - Route Targets: `export` and `import` configurations are set to `100:1` (commonly used values for demonstration).

2. **Interface Configuration**:
   - Interface: `GigabitEthernet0/1` (which connects to `CE-A1` with IP `10.0.4.2`).

3. **BGP Configuration**:
   - AS Number of `PE`: `100`, assuming a placeholder since not provided.
   - Address-family configuration for `ipv4` tied to VRF `Client_A`.
   - Neighbor set to `10.0.4.1` with AS `200` (using `ConnectedRouter's data`).

### Notes:
- The AS numbers and Route Target values can be adjusted based on your actual requirements.
- Ensure that the interface configurations align with your physical setup.
